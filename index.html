          <h1>YAT.js</h1>
          <p>An easy to integrate timeline written in CoffeeScript and SCSS</p>

          <p>yat.js is the only timeline that feels right on touch
            devices and on the desktop.</p>

          <h3>Mobile and touch built right into it</h3>
          <p>yat.js feels incredibly smooth on your smartphone or tablet</p>

          <h3>Accessible and Search Engine Optimized</h3>
          <p>yat.js was built with accessibility in mind. This is why yat.js reads all data from a table. The table is readable for screen readers and yat.js adds the timeline on top. That way everyone can access your information. Search engines too of course.</p>

          <h3>Easy to integrate into existing webpages</h3>
          <p>yat.js is a jQuery plugin. All you have to do is output your data as a table and include this piece of code:</p>
          <pre>
$("#yat-table1").yat(
  {
    items:"tbody tr",
    category:"td.yat-category",
    content:"td.yat-content",
    date:"td.yat-date",
    shorttitle:"td.yat-title",
    tags:"td.yat-tags",
    important:"tr"
  },
  "#yat-table1-timeline",
  {
    alterImportant:function (element) {
      return element.hasClass("important");
  }
});
          </pre>

          <h3>Open Source</h3>
          <p>yat.js is distributed under the GNU-GPLv3</p>

          <h3>Who's behind the project?</h3>
          <p>The timeline was built by <a href="http://twitter.com/benfreu">Ben Freundorfer</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/franzwilding">Franz Wilding</a> for the <a href="http://bmg.gv.at/">Austrian Ministry of Health</a> (German website) who agreed to releasing it as open source after the project's end. Just one sign of how open-minded and cool the people are who work there.</p>
